# SITUATION
Instacart is a grocery ordering and delivery app that helps customers fill their refrigerators and pantries with personal favorites and staples. The company provided a dataset containing over 3 million grocery orders from more than 200,000 users, offering a unique insight into customer buying habits and preferences.

# TASK
The project aimed to predict which products customers would order next, using historical order data. This required analyzing the sequence of purchased products, order timing, and frequency to understand buying patterns and customer behavior.

# ACTION
I utilized Python for data manipulation and visualization to analyze the dataset. Key actions included:

* Cleaning and preprocessing the data to ensure accuracy and usability.
* Creating visualizations to identify patterns in order timing, product popularity, and reordering rates.
* Applying statistical methods to analyze reordering behavior and product trends.
# RESULT
The project uncovered several important trends:

* Many customers (685) regularly buy the same items, usually reordering within a week.
* Saturday afternoons and Sunday mornings are the busiest shopping times, with the highest number of orders.
* A lot of items that are bought are reordered on the same day (75%) or within the same week (68%).
* Although only 10% of all orders are for organic items, these products have a high reorder rate of 40%, showing a strong preference among a segment of customers.
  
These insights can help Instacart better understand and predict customer habits, leading to improved marketing strategies and a better shopping experience.
